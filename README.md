# Sandbox

Windows Sandbox Tool

INTRODUCTION

A tool that is useful in exploring the concepts of trustworthy computing. This assignment also introduces security software and attributes that will be explored further in the second assignment, and acts as a foundation for software development for the third assignment of the module.

When running an executable programs from various random authors, such as student delivered code or untested applications from the internet, we are potentially risking our computer to being compromised. The code may inadvertently contain a malware vector or could even be deliberately constructed to perform unwanted actions on our machine, such as damage files or access otherwise hidden data.
